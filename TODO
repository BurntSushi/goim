- Fill in commands for listing specific types of information like goofs,
  quotes, running time, etc.
- Come up with a clever way of displaying a quick summary of an entry.
- Add running time to search interfaces.
  (Requires table joins in imdb/search.go.)
- Tons of documentation and refactoring left to do.


Utilities
=========
- Rename TV series episodes.
- Get information about movie/tvshow/episode from file name.
  (Probably just a regular search query, but maybe we can be clever.
   For example, many file names include the year, which could really help
   narrow down the search. Or episode names usually have a string that looks
   like "S01E01" in it. That would allow us to restrict searching to episode
   names with season/episode numbers.)
- TV show schedules? I don't think IMDb has this information, but maybe we
  can look at another place.
- Subtitles? I don't think IMDb has this information, but maybe we can
  look at another place.


Secondary
=========
- Loaders for actor/actress biographical information.
- Other crew information, e.g., directors, producers, etc.
- Loader for sound track info.
  (Difficult to parse. Maybe only pick some of it?)
