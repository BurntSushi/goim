Ideas for search
================
- Add "connected" option. (To search links.)


Soon
====
- Add running time to search interfaces.
  (Requires table joins in imdb/search.go.)


Utilities
=========
- TV show schedules? I don't think IMDb has this information, but maybe we
  can look at another place.
- Subtitles? I don't think IMDb has this information, but maybe we can
  look at another place.


Secondary
=========
- Loaders for actor/actress biographical information.
- Other crew information, e.g., directors, producers, etc.
- Loader for sound track info.
  (Difficult to parse. Maybe only pick some of it?)
